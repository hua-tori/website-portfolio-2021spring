The following is an edited template that I found off of templated.co and was created by perfect for my plan to make the website. So far, I have removed some superfluous and unnecessary parts of the code that is not needed for my own website which is the contact form section. I am still debating whether or not to remove the social media section in general. Then, I have spent most of my time finding and replacing the necessary thumbnail and full images that correspond with each preview. A shocking amount of time has been spent simply understanding the layout of the template, and playing around with what edits cause what change in the main html page.

What I have to do left is:
- Find the rest of the 3 portraits of loved ones (waiting on people to text me back)
- Write the blurb that is in the caption of each one
- Apply a new image as the banner
- Decide whether or not to delete the generic page (debating on turning that into a personal note about why I created
  the webpage and a little bit about me)
- I need to play around with formatting and seeing what I can do to make everything look neat.

Overall, I feel more and more comfortable with the template the more I use it. There are a lot of parts to the template that I do not fully
understand, so I need to possibly go to office hours and decipher it with Professor Miller so we will see. I actually am now considering changing the background colors a little bit, and seeing what I can do with that in terms of aesthetics.
In general, I am pretty excited about this project since it took my idea from the proposal and made it 10x better with the template being much cleaner than anything I could do IRL. I am also excited to share this final project in its completion to my loved ones. This project is tedious but I am glad I incorporated parts that I am passionate about to make me work double hard on it.
