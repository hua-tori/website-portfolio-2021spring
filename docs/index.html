											<a href="images/fulls/01.jpg"><img src="images/thumbs/01.jpg" alt="" title="These are my parents King and Tam. I miss them
												everyday since they live in the Philadelphia area and I am currently here in Pittsburgh for university. My parents aren't
												perfect, as most parents aren't, but they have raised me well and I cannot imagine life without them. They drive me to
												keep working hard, and to never forget my goals and ambitions. I love them from the bottom of my heart, and I know that
												one day I will take care of them the way they have taken care of me for all my life. Their drive and continuous efforts to
												give me the best life they can is something that keeps me focused on my own future in order to give back to them. This is a picture
												of the first teachers I ever had, and the ones I love the most." /></a>

											<a href="images/fulls/05.jpg"><img src="images/thumbs/05.jpg" alt="" title="This is my beautiful friend Jessica. She is a Pitt Pharmmacy student
												and she is one of the smartest and most hard working people I have ever met. Jessica is so self-disciplined, and she gets her work done now matter what
												with no excuses and no complaining. I admire her work ethic and strive to be that disciplined and hard-working. She is also very hard on herself, which I wish
												she would let up on because she is one of the kindest peopl I know. Yet she is so mean to herself." /></a>
										</div>
										<div class="media">
											<a href="images/fulls/09.jpg"><img src="images/thumbs/09.jpg" alt="" title="This is one of my best friends and roommates, Lexi. She is one of the funniest
												people I know, and she is also so smart and hard-working. Life has not been easy for Lexi, but no matter what, she has always pushed through
												and has found - and will continue to find - a way to achieve her dreams. I admire this about her very very much. Lexi doesn't talk much about her troubles,
												but she is always there for others in their time of need. In her being so good at taking care of others, she sometimes doesn't take care of herself.
												Lexi is a truly selfless person. Almost to a fault." /></a>

										<div class="media">
											<a href="images/fulls/02.jpg"><img src="images/thumbs/02.jpg" alt="" title="This is one of my best friends and roommate, the absolutely gorgeous Jacob.
												Jacob loves to rock climb and workout, and it really shows. I admire Jacob for his dedication to physical fitness, and his ordered personality. I have never met someone
												so inclined to clean and organize like him. Jacob is so kind-hearted, and his patience is never ending. A naturally sunny person with a penchant for
												not talking about his emotions, Jacob could open up more about his own problems and cloudy days." /></a>

											<a href="images/fulls/06.jpg"><img src="images/thumbs/06.jpg" alt="" title="This is my beautiful and kind-hearted cousin, Vy. I don't have any siblings, but I
												consider Vy like a sister to me. I am very bad with keeping up with family since school and work consistently overwhelm me, but I know that despite
												all this, Vy will always be understanding and there for me. I wish I could see Vy more since seeing someone sporadically every couple of months
												makes the meetings feel a little strange, but Vy's company always feels easy. Vy has not always had the easiest family life, but she has
												always pushed forward and kept working insanely hard to achieve her dreams. I have always admired her for this. She has never let
												life jade her or make her cruel. I miss her so much, and she is a top tier person if you ask me." /></a>

											<a href="images/fulls/10.jpg"><img src="images/thumbs/10.jpg" alt="" title="This is my beautiful and tiny cousin, Nhi. She is about to graduate Temple
												and enter the big world and I am really proud of her. She and I see each other once or twice a year just because we are both bad at planning
												and busy, but it is always good to hear from her and know how she is doing. Nhi is an extremely tough resilient person. She has gone through
												alot and nothing was ever just handed to her. Her whole life she has worked for everything she has, and I respect her so much for that.
												I am excited to see her again. I miss her." /></a>

										<div class="media">
											<a href="images/fulls/03.jpg"><img src="images/thumbs/03.jpg" alt="" title="This is my beautiful and intelligent friend and roommate, Ami.
												She is also one of my best friends, and she is another extremely driven individual. The past couple of years have been extremely challenging for
												Ami, but she has consistently pushed through and continues to push through everyday. She is a woman with a plan and I know she will pursue those
												plans until they are all achieved to their fullest potential or she is 6 feet under. That is just the type of person she is, and I admire
												her very much for that. She is not one to be satisfied with something just because it is comfortable. Almost to a fault, she is driven. Sometimes,
												I worry she pushes herself too much. But if anyone can do it, I know it is Ami." /></a>
										</div>
										<div class="media">
											<a href="images/fulls/07.jpg"><img src="images/thumbs/07.jpg" alt="" title="This is my handsome and sweet boyfriend, Christian. I debated
												doing a little post for him since this could be deemed extremely cringey, but I figured, why not, since this is a project about people I love and
												care about and I very much love and care about Christian. Christian is an extremely hard-working, driven, and self-disciplined individual. I admire
												him so much for this. Not only that, but he is such a patient and kind person, and one of the most considerate people I have ever met in my life.
												Christian does not let much bother him, and when life gives him a penalty, he still manages to get a try. Much love and admiration for this man." /></a>
