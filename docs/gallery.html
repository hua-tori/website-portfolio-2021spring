												<a href="images/fulls/01.jpg"><img src="images/thumbs/01.jpg" alt="" title="These are my parents King and Tam. I miss them everyday since they live in the Philadelphia area and I am currently here in Pittsburgh for university. My parents aren't perfect, as most parents aren't, but they have raised me well and I cannot imagine life without them. They drive me to keep working hard, and to never forget my goals and ambitions. I love them from the bottom of my heart, and I know that
													one day I will take care of them the way they have taken care of me for all my life. Their drive and continuous efforts to
													give me the best life they can is something that keeps me focused on my own future in order to give back to them. This is a picture
													of the first teachers I ever had, and the ones I love the most." /></a>

												<a href="images/fulls/05.jpg"><img src="images/thumbs/05.jpg" alt="" title="This is my beautiful friend Jessica. She is a Pitt Pharmmacy student
													and she is one of the smartest and most hard working people I have ever met. Jessica is so self-disciplined, and she gets her work done now matter what
													with no excuses and no complaining. I admire her work ethic and strive to be that disciplined and hard-working. She is also very hard on herself, which I wish
													she would let up on because she is one of the kindest peopl I know. Yet she is so mean to herself." /></a>

												<a href="images/fulls/09.jpg"><img src="images/thumbs/09.jpg" alt="" title="This is one of my best friends and roommates, Lexi. She is one of the funniest
													people I know, and she is also so smart and hard-working. Life has not been easy for Lexi, but no matter what, she has always pushed through
													and has found - and will continue to find - a way to achieve her dreams. I admire this about her very very much. Lexi doesn't talk much about her troubles,
													but she is always there for others in their time of need. In her being so good at taking care of others, she sometimes doesn't take care of herself.
													Lexi is a truly selfless person. Almost to a fault." /></a>

												<a href="images/fulls/02.jpg"><img src="images/thumbs/02.jpg" alt="" title="This is one of my best friends and roommate, the absolutely gorgeous Jacob. Jacob loves to
													rock climb and workout, and it really shows. I admire Jacob for his dedication to physical fitness, and his ordered personality. I have never met someone
													so inclined to clean and organize like him. Jacob is so kind-hearted, and his patience is never ending. A naturally sunny person with a penchant for
													not talking about his emotions, Jacob could open up more about his own problems and cloudy days." /></a>

												<a href="images/fulls/06.jpg"><img src="images/thumbs/06.jpg" alt="" title="This is my beautiful and kind-hearted cousin, Vy. I don't have any siblings, but I
													consider Vy like a sister to me. I am very bad with keeping up with family since school and work consistently overwhelm me, but I know that despite
													all this, Vy will always be understanding and there for me. I wish I could see Vy more since seeing someone sporadically every couple of months
													makes the meetings feel a little strange, but Vy's company always feels easy. Vy has not always had the easiest family life, but she has
													always pushed forward and kept working insanely hard to achieve her dreams. I have always admired her for this. She has never let
													life jade her or make her cruel. A top tier person if you ask me." /></a>

												<a href="images/fulls/10.jpg"><img src="images/thumbs/10.jpg" alt="" title="This is my beautiful and tiny cousin, Nhi. She is about to graduate Temple
													and enter the big world and I am really proud of her. She and I see each other once or twice a year just because we are both bad at planning
													and busy, but it is always good to hear from her and know how she is doing. Nhi is an extremely tough resilient person. She has gone through
													alot and nothing was ever just handed to her. Her whole life she has worked for everything she has, and I respect her so much for that.
													I am excited to see her again. I miss her." /></a>

												<a href="images/fulls/03.jpg"><img src="images/thumbs/03.jpg" alt="" title="This is my beautiful and intelligent friend and roommate, Ami.
													She is also one of my best friends, and she is another extremely driven individual. The past couple of years have been extremely challenging for
													Ami, but she has consistently pushed through and continues to push through everyday. She is a woman with a plan and I know she will pursue those
													plans until they are all achieved to their fullest potential or she is 6 feet under. That is just the type of person she is, and I admire
													her very much for that. She is not one to be satisfied with something just because it is comfortable. Almost to a fault, she is driven. Sometimes,
													I worry she pushes herself too much. But if anyone can do it, I know it is Ami." /></a>

												<a href="images/fulls/07.jpg"><img src="images/thumbs/07.jpg" alt="" title="This is my handsome and sweet boyfriend, Christian. I debated
													doing a little post for him since this could be deemed extremely cringey, but I figured, why not, since this is a project about people I love and
													care about and I very much love and care about Christian. Christian is an extremely hard-working, driven, and self-disciplined individual. I admire
													him so much for this. Not only that, but he is such a patient and kind person, and one of the most considerate people I have ever met in my life.
													Christian does not let much bother him, and when life gives him a penalty, he still manages to get a try. Much love and admiration for this man." /></a>

												<a href="images/fulls/11.jpg"><img src="images/thumbs/11.jpg" alt="" title="This is my beautiful and bootylicious friend, Maggie. We went
													to high school together and she is still one of my best friends from back home to this day. Maggie is kind with a snarky side to her, I
													know that if I ever need just a chill day to drive around and do errands while gossiping or complaining or just catching up, Maggie is the
													woman. I am excited to grab a drink with her soon when I visit home again." /></a>

												<a href="images/fulls/04.jpg"><img src="images/thumbs/04.jpg" alt="" title="This is my sweetheart of a friend, Elizabeth. She and I met in
													elementary school, and through the ups and downs, still remained friends after high school. She has been a monumental person in my life
													and it has been amazing growing alongside her. She is one of the most fiercely loyal people I know, and when she cares about someone, she
													have their back forever. I miss our spontaneous Rita trips. I can't wait to see her soon in one of our annual random catch-up sessions." /></a>

											<div class="media all place">
												<a href="images/fulls/08.jpg"><img src="images/thumbs/08.jpg" alt="" title="This is my beautiful and brilliant friend, Taylor. We met in
													high school and ever since she has been one of my best friends from home. She is so funny and sweet, and she always gets her work done with
													little to no excuses or complaints. It is scary sometimes how driven she is. Taylor can be pretty hard on herself, and see the negatives in
													herself that are not even there or not a big deal. All people have flaws after all. If Taylor was as good to herself as she is to others,
													I believe she would be self-actualized by now. I miss her very much and I am excited to talk about anime and life with her soon. " /></a>

												<a href="images/fulls/12.jpg"><img src="images/thumbs/12.jpg" alt="" title="This is my smart, beautiful, and unreal friend, Sarah. We met back in
													middle school but we became close in high school. Sarah is the definition of a go-getter. I have never seen this woman stop moving or doing
													something. I sometimes wonder if in another life she was a hummingbird, and if she ever stops go-go-going, her heart would simply stop too.
													Despite my worries about her over-exhausting herself, I do admire her so much for her drive, and also her intelligence. Sarah has always excelled
													in academics despite also having a thriving social life and staying active. As I said, and unreal woman. I miss her and can't wait to get a drink
													with her soon." /></a>
