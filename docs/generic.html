									<h1>Why I Created This</h1>
								</header>
								<p> I have just been missing home a lot and I figure I might has well create this to make a normal class assignment into a passion project.
								With classwork becoming overwhelming and most of my classes being a cycle of exams, papers, and assignments, I wanted to put some sort
							of emotion into this one. I also wanted to create something that I could be proud and happy to show my loved ones, since showing them a Biochemistry
						exam is not nearly as cool as this. Overall, coding has been not really my cup of tea, but being able to see the final product like this has made me super
					proud. It is not perfect, and it could be better, but I am still happy with it. I hope this makes you want to call your parents or tell those in your
				lives you care about that you love them. Give them a hug. Make a good memories. </p>

										<h3>About Me</h3>
										<p> I am a Junior at the University of Pittsburgh. I am a Psychology major pursuing the pre-Physician Assistant track and I know nothing
										about coding. This has been an challenging yet interesting project for me. I have always been in awe of how website designers and video game
									creators create their content. Of course this is only the bare bones of all of that work and expertise, and what I have done barely scratches
								the surface of what those teams of experts do, but it has been nice to dip my toes in and nearly drown in learning all of this language. Maybe
							one day down the line, I can learn even more. But for now, I think I will stick with anatomy and physiology lab.</p>
