The following is a website I have created using a template from Templated.co and have turned it into a sort of showcasing/diary of
the people I love and care about in my life and how I feel about them. There are 3 pages to this website:
a homepage with a preview of the people I care about, the full gallery page, and a page documenting why I created this project and
a litte bit about me. A sort of readme.md for the website itself.  I have been missing home a lot and I figure I might has well create this to make a normal class assignment into a passion project. With classwork becoming overwhelming and most of my classes being a cycle of exams, papers, and assignments, I wanted to put some sort of emotion into this one.

There are three HTML files for the website labelled index, generic, and gallery.
Index is the homepage featuring a preview of the gallery, generic is the about me section, and the gallery is the complete gallery of photos.
The coding uses some of the basic things we learned in the online tutorials, such as unorganized list, paragraphs, headers, sections, and different classes. However, a new thing that I learned was the use of “href=#blank”, which apparently creates a hover link to other pages or things, which is super neat.
I won’t pretend to fully understand everything, since this template still confuses me deeply, but I felt like I learned a lot. Like how you kind of learn how to float when you’re thrown in the deep end.
